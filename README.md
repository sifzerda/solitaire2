# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## TO DO:

+ [x] resize boxes to cards
+ [x] add 52 card deck (52 boxes)
+ [x] format boxes into deck of cards (stack)
+ [x] add foundation drop rules
+ [ ] add stockpile -> tableaux drop rules
+ [ ] shuffle cards every page refresh
+ [ ] add button to restart (re-initialize cards) game
+ [ ] track player moves (using phaser system)
+ [ ] make sub-level tableaux cards facedown
+ [ ] click to cycle stockpile cards and loop

### LATER:
+ [ ] add card images (later)
+ [ ] create start screen
+ [ ] create end game (show score and moves) page
+ [ ] highscore page

## Tech Used:
+ react-router
+ phaser
